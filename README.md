# Code interpreter

This was my school project in course IPP in VUT FIT. 
Our task was to create program that will interprete IPPcode19 language (assembly language like). See more in project_details.pdf

## Project is devided to two parts:

### First part in PHP 
the goal was to create script, which will check if given IPPcode19 code is lexically and syntactically correct and print
itâ€™s xml representation to STDOUT. (More in reade1.pdf) 7/7b

### Second part in Python 
the goal was to create script, that will interpret xml representation of IPPcode19 source code. (More in reade2.pdf) 12/13b
